"""
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain
 a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.
 2 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 105,
-105 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 105.
	- [output] boolean
	- Return true if it is possible to remove one element from the array in order to get 
        a strictly increasing sequence, otherwise return false.
